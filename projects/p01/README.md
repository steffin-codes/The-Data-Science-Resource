> > Presenting a simple implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm. This web app requires an image, which will be fed to the K-means algorithm, which will detect the colors and calculates the weights of each color. This is then graphed into a pie chart that looks like a Color Palette!

> ### **What has been addressed?**
> >
> >To generate a custom color palette based on a visually appealing image.
> 
> ### **Why has this been addressed?**
> >
> >For an artistically impaired designer/developer choosing a color palette for their next big project can be quite demanding.
> 
> ### **How has this been addressed?**
> >
> >With this nifty tool, you can upload your image from which a customizable number of colors can be extracted using the `K-means clustering` algorithm and displayed as a pie chart (a.k.a) **The Color Palette**.

> ## 📝 Note to Self
>
> ### **Something New**
> > Since this was my first project everything is **new ✨**
> > - `streamlit` is awesome 🎈
> > - `opencv-python-headless` is fancy
> > - `sklearn.cluster.KMeans` does everything for you!
> > 
> 
> ### **Work on**
> > Need to learn the Math behind the K-means. I know the graph but not the math 😬
>
> ### **Future Improvement**
> > Show named colors
