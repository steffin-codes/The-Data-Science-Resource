# Palette generator using K-Means

Presenting a simple implementation of the K-means ML algorithm. This web app requires an image, which will be fed to the K-means algorithm, which will detect the colors and calculates the wieghts of each color. This is then graphed into a pie chart that looks like a Palette!

More to this later :)
