# Sarcasm Detector

The goal of Sarcasm Detection is to determine whether a sentence is sarcastic or non-sarcastic. Sarcasm is a type of phenomenon with specific perlocutionary effects on the hearer, such as to break their pattern of expectation. Consequently, correct understanding of sarcasm often requires a deep understanding of multiple sources of information, including the utterance, the conversational context, and, frequently some real world facts.
